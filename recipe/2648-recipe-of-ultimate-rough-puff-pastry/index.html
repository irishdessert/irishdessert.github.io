<p><i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to rough puff pastry recipe. To make rough puff pastry you only need <strong>3</strong> ingredients and <strong>9</strong> steps. Here is how you do that.
</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-rough-puff-pastry">The ingredients needed to make Rough Puff Pastry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Use 450 g x chilled plain flour</li>
<li>Take 375 g x diced cold butter</li>
<li>Take 250 ml x cold water</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-rough-puff-pastry">Steps to make Rough Puff Pastry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>The butter, flour and water all need to be well chilled for this recipe, combine the butter and flour first and stir with a knife to make sure the butter is coated, then add the water and mix. (you don't need to thumb this pastry)</li>
<li>Work the ingredients together with your hand then turn onto the work-top, work it with your hands until it forms a dough. (if it is too dry, get your hands wet and continue to work it. Then form into a rough rectangle shape.</li>
<li>Roll out the pastry into a large rectangle on a floured work surface, to about 1/2 cm thickness. You need to fold the top to just passed the middle then fold the bottom edge back over, this creates a tripple layer dough.</li>
<li>Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll out to the same sized rectangle as before, then repeat the folding over. This creates more layers,</li>
<li>With your finger make 2 dents in the corner to remind you how many times it's been rolled and folded, at this stage wrap with cling film and refrigerate for 15 - 20 minutes to cool the butter. Roll and fold again. Each time you roll, rotate 90 degrees</li>
<li>Keep repeating the rolling and folding until it has had 6 times, if at any time the butter feels sticky, put back in the fridge to re-set the butter. The second image shows how it looks after the 6th fold. I then made some cheesy palmiers with some left over pastry after the sausage rolls. Roll and brush with beaten egg.</li>
<li>I sprinkled mixed seeds then paprika and finally grated parmesan cheese over the pastry, press down with your hands.</li>
<li>Roll the pastry into a log and cut with a sharp knife into 1cm approx discs</li>
<li>Bake at 190c for about 15-20 minutes, let them cool to room temperature before eating. These screen shots were taken from my youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVA4iX5vd4U&amp;amp;t=366s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVA4iX5vd4U&amp;amp;t=366s</a> feel free to check me out there</li>
</ol>
<p>Cooking Rough Puff Pastry Rough puff pastry also goes by the moniker &quot;flaky pastry,&quot; but the overall idea is the same. Pieces of butter, instead of a rolled out block, are incorporated into the dough in a method just like pie crust—then folded and rolled out to create layers. Rough puff pastry is a cheat's way of making puff pastry, a QUICK AND EASY Puff Pastry, if you will. Using a round-bladed knife, stir the butter into the bowl until each piece is well coated with flour. Pour in the water, then, working quickly, use the knife to bring everything together to a rough.</p>
