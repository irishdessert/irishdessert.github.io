<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-prepare-slow-cooker-pork-with-peach-bbq-sauce">The ingredients needed to prepare Slow Cooker Pork with Peach BBQ Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Provide 2 Tsp Paprika</li>
<li>You need 11/4 Tsp Kosher Salt, divided</li>
<li>You need 1 Tsp Course ground black Pepper</li>
<li>Take 1 Pork Shoulder (original recipe called for bone in)</li>
<li>Use 1/2 Cup Chicken Stock</li>
<li>Get 1/2 Cup Balsamic Vinegar</li>
<li>You need 1/2 Cup Molasses</li>
<li>Prepare 2 Tsp Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce</li>
<li>Provide 1 Tsp Crushed Red Pepper</li>
<li>Take 1/2 Cup Peach Preserves</li>
<li>Use 1/2 Diced White Onion</li>
<li>Take 5 Tsp Minced Garlic</li>
<li>You need 1/4 Cup Bourbon Whiskey</li>
<li>Get 2 Tbsp Cold Water</li>
<li>Use 2 Tsp Corn Starch</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-slow-cooker-pork-with-peach-bbq-sauce">Instructions to make Slow Cooker Pork with Peach BBQ Sauce:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a well ventillated kitchen, or on your grill on your balcony, braise the pork 2.5 Minutes on each side, in a large cast iron or stainless steel pan coated with Pam or Canola oil, and put the pork shoulder in the crock pot, and turn it on low.</li>
<li>In a non reactive bowl, mix the chicken stock, balsamic vinegar, Molasses and Soy Sauce. Pour it into the pan you cooked the pork roast in, bringing it nearly to a boil. Use a whisk to deglaze the pan for about 10 Minutes. Pour the mixture back into the non reactive bowl, and transfer it (pour it over the pork shoulder in the slow cooker).</li>
<li>Sprinkle the diced white onions over the Pork Shoulder, along with the minced Garlic. Using a spoon, spread the peach preserves over the top of the Pork Shoulder. Cook the Pork Shoulder on Medium for 1.5 - 2 hours, then you can shift the temperature back to low, and cook it on low for 3.5 hours or so. Temp the Pork Shoulder, and it should be close to 170 degrees which it's safe to serve at.</li>
<li>After the Pork Shoulder has slow cooked for 4.5 to 5.5 hours or so, assuming some of the cook time was done at Medium rather than low the entire time. If it cooked at low, I'd suggest cooking at least 6.5 hours, and making sure the meat temperature reaches a safe 170 degrees.</li>
<li>Drain the juices from the slow cooker pot, strain them into a gravy separator, and let sit for 10 minutes to drain off the fat from the gravy. This should render about 3 cups of liquid. Add the bourbon. Reduce the liquid in a non stick fry pan, keeping it moving and scraping the pan the entire time until it boils off about 2/3 to 1/2 of the 3 cups. Mix 2 tablespoons of cold water with the cornstarch in a small bowl or ramekin, and add it to the reduced juices, to thicken it into a gravy.</li>
<li>Slice the roast and serve it with garlic baby potatoes, and green beans, with gravy on the side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Place the meat on top of the onions and garlic. Take the stress out of planning and cooking midweek family meals with one of our slow cooked pork recipes. Our recipes include a selection of roasts and pulled pork meals, all of which are easy to make and can be cooked in a few simple steps.
