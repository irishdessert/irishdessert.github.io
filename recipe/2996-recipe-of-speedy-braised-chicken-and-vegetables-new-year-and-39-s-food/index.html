<p><i>Before you jump to Braised Chicken and Vegetables (New Year's Food) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Your Overall Health Can Be Impacted By The Foods You Decide To Consume</strong>.</i>
</br></p>
<p>One thing that some of you may already recognize is that by eating the right foods can have a huge effect on your health. It&rsquo;s also advisable to comprehend that there are foods that you&rsquo;ll want to avoid at all costs and that would be the majority of food you find at the fast food chain restaurants. These sorts of foods are filled with bad fat and also have very little nutritional value. This is why we are going to be going over the foods that you should be consuming that will have a positive effect on your health.</p>
<p>Also when it comes to having a dessert after your meals you should think about having various citrus fruits. In addition to vitamin C, you will discover that there are plenty of other health benefits that you will find in these fruits. One desert that I have always loved is orange pieces combined together with shredded coconut and mixed together with a light honey dressing.</p>
<p>By following some of the suggestions above you will find that you will end up living a healthier life. One thing that you ought to actually avoid is all of the processed foods which you can purchase in the stores, and start cooking fresh foods for your meals.</p>
<p><i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to braised chicken and vegetables (new year's food) recipe. You can have braised chicken and vegetables (new year's food) using <strong>10</strong> ingredients and <strong>6</strong> steps. Here is how you achieve that.
</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-braised-chicken-and-vegetables-new-year39s-food">The ingredients needed to make Braised Chicken and Vegetables (New Year's Food):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Use 200 grams Chicken thighs</li>
<li>Prepare 100 grams Lotus root</li>
<li>Prepare 100 grams Burdock root</li>
<li>Take 1/2 block Konnyaku</li>
<li>You need 100 grams Bamboo shoots</li>
<li>You need 70 grams Carrot</li>
<li>Get 4 Fresh shiitake mushrooms</li>
<li>Use 1 tbsp Sugar</li>
<li>Use 2 tbsp Soy sauce</li>
<li>You need 2 tbsp Mirin</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-braised-chicken-and-vegetables-new-year39s-food">Instructions to make Braised Chicken and Vegetables (New Year's Food):</h5>
<ol>
<li>Cut the chicken into smaller bite-sized pieces. Cut the bamboo shoots into 5 mm thick quarter-rounds. Cut the shiitake mushrooms into pieces. Peel the carrot and cut into smaller rolling slices.</li>
<li>Shave the skin off the burdock root using the back of a knife, and cut diagonally into 6-7 mm wide slices. Peel the lotus root, and cut into 6-7 mm wide semicircular slices (If they are too big, cut into quarter-rounds), then soak in water with a small amount of vinegar (excluded from the recipe). Rinse the burdock root and lotus root under running water, and drain in a sieve.</li>
<li>Cut the konnyaku into 6 mm wide strips. Make a slit lengthwise in the middle of each piece, and thread one end through the hole to make a &quot;rein knot&quot;. Parboil in boiling water for about 1 minute, and transfer into the sieve.</li>
<li>Add vegetable oil, bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, carrot, burdock root, lotus root, and konnyaku into a pot. Turn on the heat and briefly stir-fry.</li>
<li>Pour enough dashi stock into Step 4 to cover the ingredients. When it starts to boil, cover with a lid, and turn down the heat to medium. When the carrot becomes soft, add in the sugar, soy sauce, and mirin, then simmer for a while.</li>
<li>Add the chicken into Step 5, and turn up the heat to high. Cook while shaking the pot occasionally until the sauce is reduced. Once the dashi stock is almost gone, it's done. Plate and top with diagonally sliced snow peas parboiled with salt if you have some.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it will last for a long time, it's good for osechi (New Year's Food). However, braising adds a new dimension to chicken taste and you will notice the difference immediately. If I were to take sides here, braised chicken. Add it to the cooked vegetables at the very end, or your chicken will be really dry and leathery. Add the cauliflower and celery root.</p>
