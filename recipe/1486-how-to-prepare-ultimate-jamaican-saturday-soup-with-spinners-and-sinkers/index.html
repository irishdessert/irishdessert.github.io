<p><i>Before you jump to Jamaican Saturday soup with spinners and sinkers 🌱 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Your Overall Health Can Be Affected By The Foods You Decide To Eat</strong>.</i>
</br></p>
<p>Many people do not realize that the foods you decide on can either help you to be healthy or can adversely effect your health. Something that you should not eat no matter what is the varied foods that you will find at all of those fast food places. The foods that you get from these fast food places are usually foods that are very unhealthy, loaded with fat and typically have little to no nutrition. For this reason we are going to be going over the food items that you should be ingesting that will have a positive effect on your health.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to the primary food items that you have for dinner, you may well want to be certain that you&rsquo;re eating plenty of fish, especially salmon, and lean protein. The beauty of salmon is that together with other nutrients it&rsquo;s also loaded with Omega-3. And when it comes to lean protein, you should remember that you only need to have about 3 ounces to get your daily requirements. Also before cooking your steak you will want to trim the fat that you can see from it to keep from taking in extra fat.</p>
<p>For people who want to begin living a more healthy life the tips above will be able to help you do that. Also if you eliminate all the unhealthy food that you should not be eating anyway, you will probably find that you could end up living a longer life.</p>

<ol>
<li>Combine the flour and water until they bake a stiff dough. Knead for a few minutes, cover and allow the dough to rest.</li>

<li>Add the veggies to the pan (apart fro the greens) and bring to a simmer.</li>
<li>Form the dough into spinners and sinkers. The spinners should be rolled into little long dumplings and the sinkers into flat rounds. This is nice for children to make and the more rustic the nicer they taste! Pop them into the pan pot to boil.</li>
<li>Add the scotch bonnets and thyme to the top of the pan and cover with enough water or stock. Bring the pot to a lively simmer and cook for 30 minutes or until cooked to your liking. Ladle into bowls baking sure everyone gets a spinner and a sinker.</li>
</ol>
<p>History Of Saturday Soup In Jamaica. Saturday soup got its name from the fact that cows were slaughtered on Friday and soup bones would spoil quickly. As a result, the soup was prepared on Saturday along with fresh vegetables from the market and the beef 'goose neck', if the butcher considered you a favourite customer. In a large pot bring water to a boil. Clean and chop soup bone/meat and add to the pot along with crushed garlic.</p>
