<p>Nuts as well as different seeds will be a much better option when you are searching for a quick snack to enjoy.

<ol>
<li>Take 2 tbsp margarine</li>
<li>Provide 4 tbsp sugar (brown sugar would do best)</li>
<li>Provide 2 fresh pears</li>
<li>You need 1 1/2 cup sugar</li>
<li>Get 1 cup crushed ground nuts</li>
<li>Provide 1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>Provide 2 eggs</li>
<li>You need 2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>You need 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>Provide 2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>Get 1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-up-side-down-fresh-pear-cake-with-nuts">Instructions to make Up-side-down fresh Pear Cake with nuts:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Peel and chop roughly the one pears thin. Mix them with white sugar and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>As you let your first step go on, melt margarine under low heat and add in your sugar and let mix to a smooth paste. Do not burn the sugar&hellip;so be gentle. Transfer in to your greased baking tin.</li>
<li>Peel and slice thinly, the remaining pears and arrange them on your baking tin systematically, creating a pattern. grease the side of your tin</li>
<li>Blend the mixture in the first to a smooth puree. add eggs and oil and mix.</li>
<li>By hand rub in the flour, salt, and baking powder then Add them to the pear mixture. Mix. Add oil, lemon and eggs and mix into a smooth batter.</li>
<li>Add in the roasted crushed nuts and mix in together adding lemon juice gently then pour the batter into prepared tin with the pears pattern and tap gently from the bottom to remove air spaces</li>
<li>Bake at 180 degrees C for 55 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer to use Green Anjou Pears. For an added crunch, you can toss sliced almonds or chopped pecans over the brown sugar before layering on the pears. Or sprinkle the nuts over the top of the cake, prior to serving. Use a combination of pears and apples for the top of the cake. Mix in melted butter, then mix in the ground almonds.</p>
