</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-prepare-pinotage-poached-pear">The ingredients needed to prepare Pinotage poached pear:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Provide 6 pears, ripe, peeled</li>
<li>Prepare 750 ml pinotage wine</li>
<li>Prepare 150 ml brown sugar</li>
<li>You need 1 lemon, zest and juice</li>
<li>Provide 1 cinnamon stick</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-pinotage-poached-pear">Instructions to make Pinotage poached pear:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a pot put all ingredrient except pears and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes</li>
<li>Peel pears but leave stems attached</li>
<li>Place pears in liquid, close with lid and poach for 30-45 minutes on low heat **Turn occasionally to ensure colour spreads evenly</li>
<li>Remove pot from heat and let cool till room temperature.</li>
<li>Place pears in container with liquid to store in fridge for a minimum of 2 hours (can be made a day in advance) before service</li>
</ol>
<p>The Anjou I'm not wild about. Softer pears like Comice or Bartlett, while tasty, will fall apart during poaching, so they'll have to go stand in the corner. Poached Pears With Quince Paste In Parmesan Cloaks; Moscato-roasted Pears And Cider-poached Apples; Poached Pear; Poached Pear With Caramel Sauce; Poached Pear With Chocolate Sauce; Poached Pear Dessert; Wine Pairings. Port; american late-harvest; Sauternes; tokay; Riesling; Cabernet Ice Wine; pear wine; moscato d'asti ; Suggest another wine varietal that pairs well with Poached Pears With. Peel the pears, then once the sugar has dissolved, reduce the heat and lower the pears into the syrup.</p>
